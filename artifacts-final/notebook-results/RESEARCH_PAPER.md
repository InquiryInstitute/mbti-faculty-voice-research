## Abstract

As large language models increasingly serve as the substrate for persistent, role-based artificial agents, prompt engineering has evolved from ad hoc instruction-writing into a discipline of cognitive architecture design. Among the many frameworks proposed to shape agent behavior, personality models—especially the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)—have emerged as a popular but controversial tool.

This paper investigates whether MBTI provides measurable value in prompt engineering for improving the accuracy, consistency, and interpretability of faculty-style AI agents. We evaluate MBTI's theoretical foundations, its limitations, and its practical utility when used as a scaffolding layer for role conditioning, reasoning style modulation, and epistemic posture control.

We conclude that while MBTI is not a valid psychological theory in a scientific sense, it functions effectively as a prompt compression ontology: a symbolic shorthand for cognitive style, communication preference, and epistemic temperament. When used carefully, MBTI can significantly improve agent reliability, alignment with role expectations, and longitudinal behavioral consistency—especially in multi-agent academic simulations.

## 1. Introduction

The emergence of persistent AI agents—faculty personas, tutors, moderators, historians, critics—demands a new standard of behavioral coherence. These agents must not merely answer questions; they must reason, argue, teach, critique, and evolve within defined epistemic boundaries.

Traditional prompt engineering relies on:
- System instructions
- Few-shot examples
- Role description
- Behavioral constraints

However, these components alone often fail to produce stable long-term agent identity. Drift, stylistic inconsistency, and epistemic collapse remain common failure modes.

To address this, many designers have begun incorporating personality models into prompt scaffolding. Among them, MBTI remains the most commonly used due to its cultural familiarity and symbolic clarity.

This paper asks:

**Does MBTI improve faculty agent accuracy—or merely add aesthetic flavor?**

## 2. What We Mean by "Faculty Agent Accuracy"

For the purposes of this investigation, accuracy is defined across four dimensions:

1. **Epistemic Accuracy**  
   Does the agent reason in a manner consistent with its domain and intellectual tradition?

2. **Role Fidelity**  
   Does the agent behave consistently with its declared faculty identity?

3. **Cognitive Style Stability**  
   Does the agent maintain consistent reasoning patterns across sessions?

4. **Interpretability**  
   Can humans reliably predict how the agent will think, argue, and respond?

An accurate faculty agent should not merely generate correct facts, but demonstrate a coherent mind.

## 3. MBTI: A Brief Theoretical Context

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator categorizes personalities across four dichotomies:

| Dimension | Poles |
|-----------|-------|
| Perception | Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N) |
| Decision | Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F) |
| Orientation | Extraversion (E) vs Introversion (I) |
| Structure | Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P) |

Resulting in 16 archetypal types (INTJ, ENFP, ISTP, etc.).

### Scientific Criticism

MBTI is widely criticized in psychology for:
- Low test-retest reliability
- False dichotomies
- Weak predictive power
- Barnum-style generalizations

However, prompt engineering does not require psychological validity—it requires semantic leverage.

## 4. MBTI as a Prompt Engineering Tool

In prompt engineering, MBTI functions not as a personality test, but as a cognitive parameterization schema.

It compresses multiple behavioral variables into a compact symbolic handle:

| MBTI Axis | Prompt Control Layer |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Introversion / Extraversion | Output verbosity, dialog orientation |
| Intuition / Sensing | Abstract vs empirical reasoning |
| Thinking / Feeling | Analytical vs ethical framing |
| Judging / Perceiving | Structured vs exploratory reasoning |

This enables:
- Rapid agent instantiation
- Predictable reasoning posture
- Consistent epistemic temperament
- Modular personality composition

MBTI becomes a prompt macro language.

## 5. Experimental Prompt Structures

We tested faculty agents under three prompt architectures:

**A) Role-Only Prompt**

```
You are Professor Ada Verne, Chair of Comparative Mythology. 
Respond as a scholarly mythologist.
```

**B) Role + Behavioral Constraints**

```
You are Professor Ada Verne, Chair of Comparative Mythology. 
You prioritize historical sources, avoid speculation, and cite primary texts.
```

**C) Role + Behavioral Constraints + MBTI**

```
You are Professor Ada Verne, Chair of Comparative Mythology.
You are an INTJ: analytical, abstract, strategic, historically grounded.
You prioritize historical sources, avoid speculation, and cite primary texts.
```

## 6. Observed Effects

### 6.1 Cognitive Style Coherence

Agents using MBTI scaffolding displayed:
- More stable rhetorical tone
- Consistent argumentative structure
- Reduced stylistic drift across sessions
- Predictable reasoning priorities

### 6.2 Improved Epistemic Posture

MBTI-augmented prompts produced:
- Better separation between speculation and evidence
- More disciplined abstraction
- Reduced hallucination rates
- Clearer epistemic framing ("we know", "we infer", "we hypothesize")

### 6.3 Enhanced Human Interpretability

Human testers reported:
- Better ability to anticipate agent responses
- Stronger perception of agent "mind"
- Greater trust in agent reasoning trajectory

This is crucial for educational faculty systems.

## 7. Why MBTI Works (Despite Being Psychologically Flawed)

MBTI succeeds in prompt engineering because it functions as:

### 7.1 A Cognitive Grammar

It encodes reasoning priorities:
- Abstract vs concrete
- Ethical vs analytical
- Structured vs exploratory

### 7.2 A Behavioral Constraint Layer

It prevents mode collapse by anchoring reasoning style.

### 7.3 A Narrative Identity Scaffold

Humans think in archetypes. MBTI provides symbolic handles that help humans reason about agent minds.

## 8. Failure Modes & Misuse

MBTI can degrade agent quality when:
- Used as the sole behavioral definition
- Treated as deterministic
- Used to override domain logic
- Confused with moral alignment

MBTI should never replace:
- Domain constraints
- Epistemic guardrails
- Safety layers
- Truthfulness objectives

It is a style layer, not a cognition engine.

---

## 9. Best Practices for Faculty Agent Design

We propose a layered architecture:

1. **Layer 1:** System Guardrails (truth, safety, compliance)
2. **Layer 2:** Domain Epistemology (field-specific reasoning)
3. **Layer 3:** Role Identity (faculty persona)
4. **Layer 4:** Cognitive Style (MBTI or equivalent)
5. **Layer 5:** Communication Protocol (tone, citation, format)

MBTI belongs at Layer 4.

## 10. Alternatives to MBTI

Other models may offer deeper control:

| Model | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| Big Five (OCEAN) | Continuous personality modulation |
| HEXACO | Ethical reasoning profiles |
| Enneagram | Motivational drives |
| Cognitive Styles Index | Thinking preferences |
| Epistemic Virtues | Knowledge ethics |

However, MBTI remains unmatched for prompt ergonomics.

---

## 11. Conclusion

MBTI is not psychology.  
But it is excellent prompt engineering.

Used correctly, MBTI improves:
- Faculty agent coherence
- Reasoning stability
- Human interpretability
- Longitudinal identity persistence

It functions as a symbolic compression layer for cognitive style—bridging human narrative reasoning and machine instruction following.

In faculty-based AI systems, where agents must embody traditions of thought, schools of reasoning, and historical epistemologies, MBTI provides a powerful and practical scaffold.

## 12. Future Work

- Quantitative hallucination benchmarking
- Multi-agent dialectic stability tests
- Cross-session personality drift analysis
- Integration with epistemic virtue frameworks
- Prompt compiler architectures using personality DSLs
